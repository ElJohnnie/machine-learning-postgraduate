# Machine Learning Postgraduate Studies Repository

Welcome to my Machine Learning Postgraduate Studies repository! This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of my projects, notes, and resources during my pursuit of a postgraduate degree in machine learning. It is organized into various subjects and units of study to help you navigate and explore the content effectively.

## Subjects and Units

### Python

This section contains my notes, projects, and exercises related to Python programming. It is divided into 9 units of study, each covering specific topics and concepts.

### Applied Statistics and Database

In this section, you'll find materials related to applied statistics and database management. I've included notes, assignments, and projects related to these subjects.

### Machine Learning

The Machine Learning section is dedicated to my exploration of machine learning algorithms, models, and techniques. You'll find my notes, projects, and practical implementations here.

### Neural Networks

The Neural Networks section focuses on in-depth studies and projects involving neural networks and deep learning. It includes both theoretical concepts and hands-on implementations.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `python/`: This directory contains subdirectories for each of the 9 units of study within the Python subject. Each unit may include notes, code snippets, and relevant exercises.
- `applied-statistics-database/`: Here, you'll find materials related to applied statistics and database subjects, including notes, assignments, and projects.
- `machine-learning/`: This directory houses my projects, notes, and practical implementations of machine learning concepts and algorithms.
- `neural-networks/`: The Neural Networks section includes detailed notes, code, and projects related to neural networks and deep learning.

Feel free to explore each section, review the materials, and interact with the projects and exercises. If you have any questions, suggestions, or feedback, please don't hesitate to get in touch. Contributions and collaborations are always welcome!
